0,A.Hu_et_al_2018_J_of_Mech_and_Phys_of_Solids_Computational analysis of particle reinforced viscoelastic polymer," The concept of representative volume element (RVE) is widely used to determine the effec- tive material properties of random heterogeneous materials. In the present work, the RVE is investigated for the viscoelastic response of particle-reinforced polymer nanocomposites in the frequency domain. The smallest RVE size and the minimum number of realizations at a given volume size for both structural and mechanical properties are determined for a given precision using the concept of margin of error. It is concluded that using the mean of many realizations of a small RVE instead of a single large RVE can retain the desired precision of a result with much lower computational cost (up to three orders of magni- tude reduced computation time) for the property of interest. Both the smallest RVE size and the minimum number of realizations for a microstructure with higher volume frac- tion ( VF ) are larger compared to those of one with lower VF at the same desired precision. Similarly, a clustered structure is shown to require a larger minimum RVE size as well as a larger number of realizations at a given volume size compared to the well-dispersed microstructures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

1,Conf_Paper_IFAC_2020_X.Yin_et_al_A Novel Strategy for High-Performance Vehicle Lateral Motion Control,": This paper presents a new design strategy for vehicle lateral motion control. In particular, the controller design problem for vehicle path following is considered. A new kind of full error-state dynamic equation incorporating more significant error states is introduced, which describes vehicle lateral dynamics with respect to the desired path, even without the curvature of the desired path acting as disturbance at the input. Thus, the feedback and the feedforward controller can be designed straightforwardly. A novel solution is provided to extract the desired feedforward steering command and the desired reference states from the varying curvature of the desired path. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency,  high performance and robustness of the developed control strategy.

INTRODUCTION Lateral vehicle motion control is an essential part for automated driving such as Highway Cruising Chauffeur, Lane Keeping Assist, Lane Change Assist and Emergency Steering Assist. For decades, researchers have been engaged in developing lateral controllers and many control schemes have been investigated. Nowadays, car makers and suppliers are developing lateral controllers for driver assistance, highly and fully automated driving systems under more realistic conditions considering sensor noise, actuator dynamics, road conditions, robustness, safety constraints and the complexity of the algorithm to embed the control algorithm into cost efficient ECUs (Electro Control Unit). Many model-based design methods have been approached for vehicle lateral motion control (Kapania et al. 2015, Ni et al. 2016, Tange et al. 2016, Schmeitz et al. 2017). Most of the mod"
2,D.Christ_2020_J_of_Safety_Res_Simulating the relative influence of tire_vehicle and driver factors on forward collision accident,"Introduction: There is currently a strong focus within the automotive industry centered on traffic safety,with topics such as distracted driving, accident avoidance technologies, and autonomous vehicles. Thesepapers tend to focus on the possible improvements from a single factor. However, there are many factorsthat are present in each accident, and it is important to understand the influence of each factor on therelative accident risk in order to identify the most effective approaches for improving driver safety.Rear-end accidents tend to be the most common accident type with approximately 1.8 M cases, or 31%of all accidents, in 2012, according to NHTSA. Of the rear-end accident scenarios, approximately 18–23% occur on wet surfaces. Method: A Monte Carlo Forward Collision Simulation models the conditionsof a wet rear-end accident and estimates the relative impact of various vehicle collision parameters.The model takes distributions of these parameters as inputs, and outputs a risk of collision relative toa known reference case. The parameters that can be studied include: tire grip level, road grip level, vehi-cle velocity, following distances, and the presence of vehicle technologies (ABS, FCW & AEB). Distributionsof some of these parameters have been improved thanks to Naturalistic Driving Study data from SHRP2.Results: This study shows that these vehicle systems have a large impact on safety and can change theamount of influence attributed to other parameters such as tire grip levels. As the use of automated vehi-cle systems expands, so will the influence of tire grip performance levels on collision risks. PracticalApplications: It is more important than ever for consumers and auto manufacturers to consider tire per-formance levels. Therefore, the tire industry should continue to focus on wet grip as a key performancerelated to safety and should strive to continue to improve tire performance."
3,D.D.Gregoriis_et_al_2019_J_of_Sound_and_Vibration_Development and validation of a fully predictive high-fidelity simulation,"In this work, a fully predictive high-fidelity numerical approach for the simulation of a cartire rolling with a constant angular velocity over a coarse road surface is presented. A fullynonlinear vibro-acoustic finite element tire model is combined with an Arbitrary LagrangianEulerian formulation to describe both the rolling dynamics as well as the interaction betweenthe tire and coarse road surface. A geometrical constraint approach is used to describethe tire/road interaction rather than a constitutive approach in order to keep the proposedmethod fully predictive, i.e. to not rely on measurement data. As both the use of a nonlinearfinite element tire model, as well as the use of the geometrical constraint approach result inlarge computational costs and simulation times, the nonlinear Multi-Expansion Modal Reduc-tion hyper-reduction method is applied. Numerical costs and corresponding simulation timesare reduced by a factor of order of magnitude 100 (from several months to hours), there-fore making the proposed approach feasible to use in an industrial design and developmentprocess. Two alternative linearized approaches, based on the proposed nonlinear approach,are considered as well. While the proposed nonlinear approach shows a good, consistentqualitative and quantitative correspondence between experimental and numerical simulationresults for the entire 0–400 Hz frequency range of interest, with normalized Power SpectralDensity differences between 0.1 and 0.2 dB (ref. 1 N/Hz), the linearized approaches are lim-ited to lower frequency ranges of 0–85 Hz and 0–200 Hz and are therefore not suitable for theintended application. The overall performance of the proposed nonlinear approach confirmsits use as a possible alternative to standard time-consuming experimental approaches.© 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

This work relies on a Generalized Self-Consistent Scheme coupled with a MorphologicallyRepresentative Pattern based approach. An analytical model is proposed to deal with ‘‘non-percolated”or trapped matrix regions. Closed-form analytical expressions are provided to investigate different kindsof morphological fluctuation effects on the effective transverse elastic behaviour. Finally some examplesare given to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach.� 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
5,J.Gao_et_al_2019_Comp_Met_Appl_Mech_Eng_An inverse modeling approach for predicting filled rubber performance,"In this paper, a computational procedure combining experimental data and interphase inverse modeling is presented to predictfilled rubber compound properties. The Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) based numerical homogenization scheme is appliedon the high quality filled rubber 3D Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) image to compute its complex shear moduli.The 3D TEM filled rubber image is then compressed into a material microstructure database using a novel Reduced OrderModeling (ROM) technique, namely Self-consistent Clustering Analysis (a two-stage offline database creation from trainingand learning, followed by data compression via unsupervised learning, and online prediction approach), for improved efficiencyand accuracy. An inverse modeling approach is formulated for quantitatively computing interphase complex shear moduli inorder to understand the interphase behaviors. The two-stage SCA and the inverse modeling approach formulate a three-stepprediction scheme for studying filled rubber, whose loss tangent curve can be computed in agreement with test data.c⃝ 2019 Elsevier B.V.

6,J.OAlmiron_et_al_2022_J_of_Sound_and_Vibration_Vehicle road noise prediction using component-based transfer path analysis,"   The current trends in the automotive industry toward electric vehicles are creating increasing interest on methods to quantify and predict the noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) behavior caused by road noise, as well as secondary noise sources. In this regard, component-based TPA (Transfer Path Analysis) has been recently explored. It is a powerful methodology allowing for a virtual prototype vehicle NVH prediction starting from independent sources and component models. The aim of this paper is to analyze the potential of the component-based TPA in the context of road noise. This methodology, on one hand, allows the tire manufacturers to charac-terize their tires on a tire test-rig independently of any vehicle and, on the other hand, enables the automotive OEMs to perform the prediction of the full system vehicle behavior starting from the test-rig measurements. However, some challenges are still hindering the application of the methodology in this context. In this regard, all the component-based TPA methodology steps are investigated in this work. A slick tire, selected for this analysis, is characterized on a test-rig by a set of blocked forces, which only depend on the source. The uncoupled tire and vehicle are experimentally characterized through the measurement of their frequency-response functions (FRFs) under a static load condition. Frequency Based Substructuring (FBS) is applied to these substructures in order to synthesize the coupled vehicle FRFs. Both rear tires are coupled to the vehicle using this approach. Finally, the vehicle road noise is predicted by propagating one of the tires’ blocked forces through the synthesized full vehicle FRFs in a modular approach. The method is validated by comparison with direct vehicle measurements. Transferability of blocked forces is also assessed by direct comparison between blocked forces estimated on vehicle and test- rig. Importantly, the rolling effect is identified and considered in a direct propagation process, analyzing its implications in the vehicle noise prediction. This paper also intends to serve as a guideline to industrialize the experimental and processing steps.  * Corresponding author. E-mail address: jesus.ortega@siemens.com (J. Ortega Almirón).

7,K.Rishi_et_al_2019_Polymer_A thermal model to describe kinetic dispersion in rubber,"Nanocomposites can be produced by a variety of processes. A common method used in industry is to mix aviscous polymer such as an elastomer compound, with nanofillers in a Brabender mixer or in a calendar.Dispersion has been quantified using a mixing index, DR, that is based on micrographs of reinforced elastomerson the micron-scale. A recently developed technique based on X-ray scattering allows for an alternative nano-scale description of dispersion based on a thermal-dispersion model where an analogy is made between tem-perature for thermal dispersion and nanocomposite processing conditions such as mixing time, mixing geometry,and viscosity for kinetic dispersion. In this paper the impact of mixing time on dispersion is investigated takingadvantage of the van der Waals equation to describe excluded volume and interaction energy in the dispersion. Itis found that the thermal-dispersion analogy is well behaved and can determine the wetting time for nano-scaleincorporation of filler into elastomer. The nano-scale excluded volume depends only on the filler type and theexcess excluded volume seems to be sensitive to the bound rubber layer. The pseudo-interaction energy isstrongly dependent on viscosity and polymer chemistry. The thermal-dispersion model offers a novel approachto understanding kinetic dispersion in nanocomposites."
8,M.Elshikka_et_al_2020_Agri_Water_Man_Estimation of direct-seeded guayule cover using UAS-based multispectral and RGB data,"   Guayule (Parthenium argentatum, A. Gray), a perennial desert shrub, produces high-quality natural rubber and is targeted as a domestic natural rubber source in the U.S. While commercialization efforts for guayule are on- going, crop management requires plant growth monitoring, irrigation requirement assessment, and final yield estimation. Such assistance for guayule management could be provided with remote sensing (RS) data. In this study, field and RS data, collected via drones, from a 2-year guayule irrigation experiment conducted at Mar-icopa, Arizona were evaluated. In-season field measurements included fractional canopy cover (fc), basal (Kcb) and single (Kc) crop coefficients, and final yields of dry biomass (DB), rubber (RY), and resin (ReY). The ob-jectives of this paper were to compare vegetations indices from MS data (NDVI) and RGB data (triangular greenness index, TGI); and derive linear prediction models for estimating fc, Kcb, Kc, and yield as functions of the MS and RGB indices. The NDVI and TGI showed similar seasonal trends and were correlated at a coefficient of determination (r2) of 0.52 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.11. The prediction of measured fc as a linear function of NDVI (r2 = 0.90) was better than by TGI (r2 = 0.50). In contrast to TGI, the measured fc was highly correlated with estimated fc based on RGB image evaluation (r2 = 0.96). Linear models of Kcb and Kc, developed over the two years of guayule growth, had similar r2 values vs NDVI (r2 = 0.46 and 0.41, respectively) and vs TGI (r2 = 0.48 and 0.40, respectively). Final DB, RY, and ReY were predicted by both NDVI (r2 = 0.75, 0.53, and 0.70, respectively) and TGI (r2 = 0.72, 0.48, and 0.65, respectively). The RS-based models enable estimation of irrigation requirements and yields in guayule production fields in the U.S.   "
9,M.Rehor_et_al_2020_J_of_Non_Newton_Fluid_Mech_A comparison of constitutive models for describing the flow of uncured styrene,"Uncured styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) can be modelled as a viscoelastic material with at least two differentrelaxation mechanisms. In this paper we compare multi-mode constitutive models combining two viscoelasticmodes (linear and/or nonlinear) in three possible ways. Our particular choice of the two modes was inspired bymodels originally developed to describe the response of asphalt binders. We select the model that best fits theexperimental data obtained from a modified stress relaxation experiment in the torsional configuration of theplate–plate rheometer. The optimisation of the five model parameters for each model is achieved by minimisingthe weighted least-squares distance between experimental observations and the computer model output usinga tree-structured Parzen estimator algorithm to find an initial guess, followed by further optimisation usingthe Nelder–Mead simplex algorithm. The results show that the model combining the linear mode and thenonlinear mode is the most suitable variant to describe the observed behaviour of SBR in the given regime.The predictive capabilities of the three models are further examined in changed experimental and numericalconfigurations. Full data and code to produce the figures in this article are included as supplementary material."
10,Q.Li_et_al_2021_Applied_Acoustics_Simulation of deterministic tyre noise based on a monopole substitution model,"This paper deals with tyre noise indoor tests in a semi-anechoic chamber and with the identification of amonopole substitution model suitable for simulating the deterministic part of the sound field generatedby a rolling tyre. The first part of the paper illustrates the test procedure and the data processing method-ology adopted for separating the deterministic contribution to tyre noise, i.e. that mainly related to treadpattern, from the random one. In the second part, the monopole substitution model is presented, togetherwith the results of model identification and sound field simulation.The results reported in the paper for two commercial tyres (with the same size and similar structuralcharacteristics, but with different tread pattern design) show how the predominance of the determinis-tic/random noise contributions varies with frequency and confirm the random noise spectrum to be sub-stantially independent of the specific tread pattern. With reference to the monopole substitution model,its capability of reproducing the acoustic field radiated by a rolling tyre is assessed through the analysis ofboth sound spectra and space distribution.� 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

11,S.Baro_et_al_2019_Modelling of a lined tyre for predicting cavity noise mitigation,"Tyre cavity resonance can significantly affect vehicle interior noise at frequencies around 200 Hz. Theinsertion of a sound absorbing liner inside the tyre is known to be an efficient countermeasure, in factnowadays tyre manufacturers are already producing tyres implementing this kind of solution. The pre-sent work, through analytical and numerical models, supported by material testing, provides a method-ology for predicting the dag performance of a lined tyre, taking into account tyre/lining geometry andsound absorbing material properties. The results reported in the paper show that for fixed material char-acteristics, the attenuation of the cavity resonance is mostly influenced by the volume of the lining treat-ment. Moreover, the numerical model developed for discontinuous treatments, suggests that for fixedvolume and material properties, the cavity resonance attenuation can be increased by choosing a properlayout.� 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

12,S.Delvecchio_et_al_2018_Mech_Sys_and_Signal_Process_Vibro-acoustic condition monitoring of Internal Combustion Engines,"This paper deals with the state-of-the-art strategies and techniques based on vibro-acoustic signals that can monitor and diagnose malfunctions in Internal CombustionEngines (ICEs) under both test bench and vehicle operating conditions. Over recent years,several authors have summarized what is known in critical reviews mainly focused onreciprocating machines in general or on specific signal processing techniques: no attemptsto deal with IC engine condition monitoring have been made. This paper first gives a briefsummary of the generation of sound and vibration in ICEs in order to place further discus-sion on fault vibro-acoustic diagnosis in context. An overview of the monitoring and diag-nostic techniques described in literature using both vibration and acoustic signals is alsoprovided. Different faulty conditions are described which affect combustion, mechanicsand the aerodynamics of ICEs. The importance of measuring acoustic signals, as opposedto vibration signals, is due since the former seem to be more suitable for implementationon on-board monitoring systems in view of their non-intrusive behaviour, capability insimultaneously capturing signatures from several mechanical components and becauseof the possibility of detecting faults affecting airborne transmission paths.In view of the recent needs of the industry to (�) optimize component structural dura-bility adopting long-life cycles, (�) verify the engine final status at the end of the assemblyline and (�) reduce the maintenance costs monitoring the ICE life during vehicle opera-tions, monitoring and diagnosing system requests are continuously growing up. The pre-sent review can be considered a useful guideline for test engineers in understandingwhich types of fault can be diagnosed by using vibro-acoustic signals in sufficient timein both test bench and operating conditions and which transducer and signal processingtechnique (of which the essential background theory is here reported) could be consideredthe most reliable and informative to be implemented for the fault in question.� 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

13,Semantic_Mapping_of_Component_Framework_Interface_," Over the past few years, ontology merging, and ontology semantic alignment has gained significant interest as research topics in automotive application domain for finding solutions to semantic data heterogeneity. To accomplish the complex and novel vehicle service requirements such as autonomous driving, V2X (Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication), etc. the automotive applications involve collaborations of several platform-specific data from heterogeneous enterprises component frameworks and consequently there has been increase in data interoperability issues. At the application component level, data interoperability relies on the semantic alignment or mapping between the various component framework interfaces data models represented as XML schemas (XSD). With the XML schemas being the preferred standard for the interface description exchange between most of the automotive application domain components, however, the data interoperability between the semantically equivalent but structurally different data constructs of  multiple heterogeneous XSDs stands as a challenge in the absence of an ontology-based approach. To confront this crucial requirement for data interoperability and to increase in effect the reuse of existing components through their interfaces, we propose an approach to semantically map the various component framework interface data models when expressed as ontology schemas, based on the exploration of semantic synergies. The transformation between XSD and RDF (Resource Description Framework) schema representations and the use of queries over the ontology schemas for semantic mapping are demonstrated including a real-world case study.  © 2020 The Authors.

14,T.Gambino_et_al_2020_Polymer_Modeling the high frequency mechanical relaxation of simplified industrial polymer mixtures,"   The mechanical characterization of rubber materials at the frequencies relevant for the tire function during braking (about 1 MHz) is extremely challenging. On the other hand, dielectric relaxation experiments provide a suitable tool for the analysis of relaxation phenomena over a broad frequency range with high sensitivity. Here we show that by analyzing dielectric relaxation experiments in the framework of a simple model the mechanical relaxation of simplified industrial systems based on mixtures of a styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) with a poly-styrene oligomer can be anticipated, at least for the SBR rich mixtures that are more relevant for development of tire polymers. The model needs the description of the dielectric and mechanical relaxation processes of the single components of the mixture and uses concepts and ideas introduced in the past for describing the segmental dynamics of athermal polymer blends. The model description of dielectric relaxation experiments on the mix-tures provides a quantification of the thermal fluctuations of concentration in the blends. With this input, the mechanical relaxation of the mixtures are calculated using well established equations for the mechanical properties of composite materials. The present approach should be helpful in a rational design of the rubber material depending on the specific requirements.   "
15,T.Ido_et_al_2019_Tribology_Int_Sliding friction characteristics of styrene butadiene rubbers,"We investigated the effect of the surface topography of rubbers on their wet sliding friction characteristics. Forsix types of rubber samples with different viscoelastic properties, rubber specimens with five levels of surfaceroughness were prepared and slid against a rough rigid surface under water lubrication. The friction coefficientincreased with increasing surface roughness for each of the rubber samples, and the rank of the friction coef-ficient of different samples varied depending on the surface roughness. These results indicate that the effect ofhysteresis friction becomes more significant as the surface roughness of the rubber increases, and the effect of theinhibition of adhesion friction caused by lubrication becomes more significant as the surface roughness de-creases. Our findings demonstrate the importance of rubber surface topography in determining the frictioncoefficient under water lubrication. The results of this study may lead to new design criteria for high-wet-griprubber tires."
16,Toward harmonizing prospective effectiveness assessment for road safety Comparing tools in standard test case simulations,"Objective: With the overall goal to harmonize prospective effectiveness assessment of activesafety systems, the specific objective of this study is to identify and evaluate sources of variationin virtual precrash simulations and to suggest topics for harmonization resulting in increasedcomparability and thus trustworthiness of virtual simulation-based prospective effective-ness assessment.Methods: A round-robin assessment of the effectiveness of advanced driver assistance systemswas performed using an array of state-of-the-art virtual simulation tools on a set of standard testcases. The results were analyzed to examine reasons for deviations in order to identify and assessaspects that need to be harmonized and standardized. Deviations between results calculated byindependent engineering teams using their own tools should be minimized if the research ques-tion is precisely formulated regarding input data, models, and postprocessing steps.Results: Two groups of sources of variations were identified; one group (mostly related to theimplementation of the system under test) can be eliminated by using a more accurately formu-lated research question, whereas the other group highlights further harmonization needs becauseit addresses specific differences in simulation tool setups. Time-to-collision calculations, vehicledynamics, especially braking behavior, and hit-point position specification were found to be themain sources of variation.Conclusions: The study identified variations that can arise from the use of different simulation set-ups in assessment of the effectiveness of active safety systems. The research presented is a first ofits kind and provides significant input to the overall goal of harmonization by identifying specificitems for standardization. Future activities aim at further specification of methods for prospectiveassessments of the effectiveness of active safety, which will enhance comparability and trust-worthiness in this kind of studies and thus contribute to increased traffic safety."
17,V.H.Nguyen_et_al_2018_Wear_An_Adv_abrasion_model_for_tire_wear,"The abrasion processes of rubber or tires are extremely complex phenomena and basically different from those ofother materials. Much research in tire industry has been done to predict the wear of a tire tread. However, suchstudies have not considered the history dependency of abrasion as well as directional effects. This paper is topropose an advanced abrasion model for rubber that will takes these two effects into account. As a result the newmodel can be applied to predict tire tread wear. Within this model, directional damage will be introduced tocharacterize the history of frictional sliding contact including the change of slip directions. It also covers localcontact conditions such as contact pressure, slip velocity or flash temperature. The model will be analyzedtheoretically and numerically. A FEM simulation for the Grosch-wheel with different loading conditions usingthe new abrasion model is performed and validated by experimental data."
18,V.Mussot_et_al_2022_Control_Eng_Pract_Model learning of the tire–road friction slip dependency under standard driving conditions,"The maximum tire–road friction coefficient is a quantity allowing to increase significantly the performanceof the driver-assistance systems. Unfortunately, this value is particularly difficult to estimate under standarddriving conditions. Therefore, this paper focuses on a parametric method based on Monte-Carlo Markov Chaintechniques to determine it accurately. Our solution combines the advantages of both a maximum likelihoodmethod and an adaptive Metropolis algorithm to determine the tire–road friction coefficient. This approachrequires friction measurements and a tire model representing the friction as a function of the slip ratio. Afterdescribing the theoretical aspects of the method, this paper focuses on its practical implementation. Severalresults obtained from both simulated data and real data are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the approach."
19,V.Sulzer_et_al_2021_Joule_The challenge and opportunity of battery lifetime prediction from field data,"Accurate battery life prediction is a critical part of the business casefor electric vehicles, stationary energy storage, and nascent applica-tions such as electric aircraft. Existing methods are based on rela-tively small but well-designed lab datasets and controlled test con-ditions but incorporating field data is crucial to build a completepicture of how cells age in real-world situations. This comes withadditional challenges because end-use applications have uncon-trolled operating conditions, less accurate sensors, data collectionand storage concerns, and infrequent access to validation checks.We explore a range of techniques for estimating lifetime from laband field data and suggest that combining machine learning ap-proaches with physical models is a promising method, enablinginference of battery life from noisy data, assessment of second-lifecondition, and extrapolation to future usage conditions. This workhighlights the opportunity for insights gained from field data toreduce battery costs and improve designs."
20,Wang_2020_J_of_Wind_Eng_and_Ind_Aerodyn_Experimental study of wheel-vehicle aerodynamic interactions,"This work aims to provide a better understanding of the wheel-vehicle aerodynamic interaction, via experimentalinvestigations on a 2/5-th scale vehicle equipped with 2/5-th scale rotating wheels. The findings demonstrate thatthe baseline configuration has a well-balanced wake, which means that the distribution of TKE in the symmetricalplane of the vehicle wake is symmetric in the upper and lower shear layers.This well-balanced wake can be easily modified by different wheel states or tire modifications, especially at therear axle. This results from a global effect of the underbody momentum modifications. On the contrary, when thevehicle mean wake develops into a non-balanced topology, it is more robust towards underbody perturbations. Byeliminating front wheels, the underbody flow momentum is vastly increased; by eliminating the underbodydiffuser, the underbody flow momentum is significantly reduced. In these two circumstances, one can observe arobust downwash from the roof, independent of the wheel states or tire modifications. Besides, there is a morelocal effect of the wheels’ near wakes on the aerodynamic lift and drag of the vehicle. Low pressure regions in theunderbody downstream the wheels have an effect on vehicle lift. The rear wheel wakes interact with vehiclewake, imposing pressure conditions on the vehicle base, therefore influencing the vehicle drag."
21,Y.Hoshikawa_et_al_2021_Carbon_Quantitative analysis of the formation mechanism of tightly bound rubber,"Using carbon-coated alumina nanoparticles as a model filler for styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), rubbercomposites with different carbon surface chemistry were prepared and the bound rubber thus formed ineach composite was analyzed in relation to the carbon surface chemistry. The present approach providesquantitative understanding of the rubber-carbon interface at the molecular level and thereby the for-mation mechanism of tightly bound rubber during a mixing process with SBR is proposed as follows. Atfirst, the strong physisorption of SBR occurs and almost all the filler surface (99.8% of the total surface) iscovered with a single-molecule layer of physisorbed SBR. The polymer radicals formed in the process arethen gradually allowed to react with the H-terminated edge sites on the exposed carbon surface (0.2% ofthe total surface) and the resulting free edge sites are chemically-bonded to the other polymer radicals toform the chemisorbed polymer. Moreover, the unique structure of the present composites makes itpossible to analyze the state of tightly bound rubber with the conventional differential scanning calo-rimetry, which strongly suggests that the tightly bound rubber is indeed in a glassy state.© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
