While nanoscale methods such as molecular dynamics are good at capturing local properties, micro/macro scale', 'modeling methods are essential for relating random heterogeneous structure to material properties. At the micro/macro', 'scale level, micromechanical models such as the Halpin–Tsai model ( Affdl and Kardos, 1976 ), the Mori-Tanaka method', '( Mori and Tanaka, 1973 ) and its extended homogenization scheme ( Schöneich et al., 2017 ) analyze composites based on', 'the response of a single inclusion in a matrix, extended in an approximate way to many inclusions. Because details of', 'microstructural features are lost in such approaches, numerical techniques for direct simulations such as the finite element', '(FE) method are widely used to analyze random heterogeneous materials based on the representative volume element (RVE)', 'concept ( Deng et al., 2012 ; Dalaq et al., 2016 ; Ostoja-Starzewski, 2006 ; Ren and Zheng, 2002 ; Ulz, 2015 ; Zhao et al., 2016 ). ', 'Generally, a RVE should be large enough to give a sufficiently accurate estimate of a certain macroscopic mean response', 'yet much smaller than the macroscopic body. Several RVE definitions have been proposed in the literature addressing', 'different research objectives. Hill (1963) described the RVE as “a sample that (a) is structurally entirely typical of the', 'whole mixture on average, and (b) contains a sufficient number of inclusions for the apparent overall moduli to be effectively', 'independent of the surface values of traction and displacement, so long as these values are macroscopically uniform ”. Drugan and', 'Willis (1996) defined it as “the smallest material volume element of the composite for which the usual spatially constant “overall', 'modulus” macroscopic constitutive representation is a sufficiently accurate model to represent mean constitutive response .” Kanit ', 'and Forest ( Kanit et al., 2003 ) proposed a more quantitative definition for the size of a RVE based on statistical arguments:', '“the size of a RVE can be defined for a given physical property, a given contrast and, above all, a given precision in the estimation', 'of the effective properties and given number of realizations that one is ready to generate.” Instead of focusing merely on the', 'RVE size, they proposed to relate the RVE size to several other conditions, among which, the requirement of sufficient', 'number of realizations for a small RVE size was emphasized. ', 'In real applications, it is often computationally expensive to use a single, strictly qualified RVE size with high precision.', 'Especially when dealing with three-dimensional FE simulations, the number of elements as well as the computation time', 'increases cubically as the length of a side increases. Statistical methods such as taking the average properties of multiple', 'realizations make it possible to achieve higher precision at a smaller size (these RVEs are sometimes referred to as statistical', 'volume elements (SVE)) ( Dalaq et al., 2016 ; Zhao et al., 2017 ; Yin et al., 2008 ). Therefore, it is especially appealing to find', 'optimal conditions avoiding one large RVE and instead using a smaller RVE with multiple realizations that reduces the', 'computational cost but still satisfies the desired precision. Utilizing Kanit and Forest’s ( Kanit et al., 2003 ) definition, in this', 'paper the RVE size and the minimum number of realizations for a certain RVE size at a given precision are determined for', 'both the structural and the viscoelastic properties of particle-reinforced polymer nanocomposites. ', 'For polymer nanocomposites, a number of studies have examined finite element simulations of RVEs ( Pahlavanpour et al.,', '2013 ; Spanos and Kontsos, 2008 ; Qiao and Brinson, 2009 ; Qiao et al., 2011 ; Mortazavi et al., 2013 ; Hbaieb et al., 2007 ;', 'Bessa et al., 2017 ; Zhang and Ostoja-Starzewski, 2015 ). In the case of spheroidal fillers and regular dispersion, it is possible', 'to obtain RVEs that are computationally tractable. However, as the inclusion structure becomes more complex (e.g. carbon', 'nanotubes (CNTs), which have high aspect ratios, or carbon black (CB), which readily agglomerated into large irregular', 'clusters), computational costs for a full three-dimensional (3D) RVE becomes computationally prohibitive ( Chen and', 'Liu, 2004 ; Liu and Chen, 2003 ; Li et al., 2012 ). This is especially true when many simulations are required in order to', 'probe response changes due to changes in structure, composition or other factors. To address the computational challenges,', 'various approaches such as the self-consistent clustering analysis (SCA) ( Liu et al., 2016 ) and the mosaic approach ( Xu et al.,', '2013 ) have been pursued. Using two-dimensional (2D) analysis instead of the 3D simulations can also save computation', 'time but often times inaccurately overestimates or underestimates impacts of various features ( Weidt and Figiel, 2014 ). ', 'In Kanit and Forest’s ( Kanit et al., 2003 ) paper, a quantitative definition of the RVE size is proposed for two-phase 3D', 'Voronoi mosaic poly-crystal composites to determine linear properties such as the effective elastic modulus and thermal', 'conductivity. In this paper, we apply the RVE calculations to nano scale composites with altered properties in between the', 'matrix and the fillers (interphase), which makes the average properties more unpredictable than traditional composites.', 'We’re interested in viscoelasticity instead of linear elasticity, and the frequency dependency added another dimension to the', 'complexity of the problem. Therefore, the size and number of realizations of the RVE need to be determined for this specific', 'type of materials with special considerations of the length scale effects and the frequency dependency. In order to take into', 'account the complex changes in composition, morphology and dispersion of nanocomposites, we apply a similar quantita-', 'tive approach to a descriptor-based ( Xu et al., 2014 a, b ) microstructure with three-phase composition, with consideration of', 'the interphase and statistically measured morphology and dispersion. This approach provides us with the ability to account', 'for the changes in the structure while probing changes in the response using statistical and quantitative measurements. The', 'RVE size concept is examined for frequency-dependent viscoelasticity instead of simple linear properties. We demonstrate', 'that the mean of sufficient smaller volume RVEs can be used in lieu of a single large RVE simulation at lower computational', 'cost yet within satisfactory error. The minimum number of realizations required to estimate the effective properties with a', 'desired precision is determined using the concept of margin of error. Our goal is to find an optimal solution to the compu-', 'tational challenge presented by a single, large, 3D RVE by finding a middle ground using the minimum number of smaller', 'RVEs for quick calculations with the desired accuracy. The dependence on the composition and dispersion of the inclusions', 'on the resultant properties is also investigated to find additional influential factors on the determination of the RVE size.

The influences of VF , composition (interphase', 'layer) and dispersion of the particles on the RVE study results are also discussed in this section. Section 4 concludes this', 'paper. ', '2. Material and methods ', 'In the past, we have developed several microstructure-based modeling frameworks for polymer nanocomposites', '( Deng et al., 2012 ; Xu et al., 2014 a, b; Qiao et al., 2011 ) utilizing both real and statistically reconstructed microstructures', 'in FE models for a particle-reinforced polymer systems. In this Section, we will briefly introduce the modeling framework', 'that is used in the current RVE study. We base our study here on a FE model using a voxelated microstructure, where the', 'nano-filler, interphase and matrix are all explicitly represented, following an approach outlined by Xu et al. (2014 a, b) . ', 'Xu et al. (2014 a, b) used a small set of descriptors to characterize microstructural features including composition, dis-', 'persion and geometry from a set of images obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The authors also developed', 'a descriptor-based, multiphase, microstructure reconstruction algorithm to provide stochastic reconstructions of microstruc-', 'tures for FE analysis of material behavior. A 3D voxelated FE model ( Fig. 1 ) was subsequently developed to predict the', 'dynamic modulus of the carbon-black-filled rubber composites based on the reconstructions and experimental input of each', 'material phase. As shown in Fig. 1 , the microstructures included three phases: rubber polymer matrix (gray voxels), carbon', 'black filler (red voxels) and the interphase (blue voxels). In the original work, the microstructure was coarsened relative to', 'the SEM, such that the physical size of the examined microstructure is 13.2 3 ( um 3 ) and the entire microstructure includes', '60 3 voxels (220 nm on each side of one voxel). The size of one voxel was determined by the real image/sample size and', 'the resolution. And the resolution we choose was limited by the computational cost (how many voxels in total we can sim-', 'ulate in a reasonable time frame). Also, the size of the aggregations of the fillers are in the range of tens to hundreds of', 'nano meters. Researches have shown that the high surface-to-volume ratio leads to high volume fraction of the interphase', '( Ramanathan et al., 2005 ; Schadler et al., 2007 ). Cheng et al. (2015) observed gradient in mechanical properties in the inter-', 'phase region which is up to 170 nm thick. With consideration of all these factors, the voxel size was set to be 220 nm thick.', 'And we assume the interphase to be one voxel (220 nm) thick, which was the smallest thickness based on the voxel size and', 'close to the length found in experimental observations. For direct comparison, we retain this structure in the current study,', 'although the results of the RVE size studies presented here are general to smaller or larger voxel sizes as long as each voxel', 'can be represented by continuum properties. The material model for the carbon black filler is taken as linear elastic with an', 'elastic modulus of 20 GPa and Poisson’s ratio of 0.3. The matrix material is 100% styrene-butadiene rubber crosslinked using', 'a conventional vulcanization (CV) recipe for 45 min at 150 °C, made by Goodyear’s Polymer Plant in Beaumont, TX. The stor-\\nage and loss modulus of the polymer matrix is measured by Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) system in the frequency', 'domain, as shown in Fig. 2 . The property of the interphase is assumed to be related to the property of the matrix by using', 'a shifting factor ( Deng et al., 2012 ), S , and two broadening factors, B L and B R ( Fig. 2 ). The assumption for the shifting and', 'broadening behaviors are based on our observation of the comparison between the master curves of the filled and unfilled', 'systems in experiments ( Deng et al., 2012 ). Validation of the shifting factor approach can be found in work presented by in', 'Deng et al. (2012) . The left broadening factor, B L and the right broadening factor, B R are defined as the following: ', 'B L = \\nlog 10 f interphase − log 10 f interphase peak ', 'log 10 f matrix − log 10 f matrix peak \\n, when f matrix ≤ f matrix peak ', 'B R = \\nlog 10 f interphase − log 10 f interphase peak ', 'log 10 f matrix − log 10 f matrix peak \\n, when f matrix > f matrix peak ', 'where f matrix is an array of the frequency points for the matrix; f interphase is the corresponding array of the frequency', 'points for the interphase; f matrix peak is the frequency at which tan δ of the matrix reaches its maximum; f interphase peak is the\\nfrequency at which tan δ of the interphase reaches its maximum. Note that f interphase peak and f matrix peak are related to the\\nshifting factor S by S = log 10 f interphase peak − log 10 f matrix peak . We will use the structure in Fig. 1 as the basis for the investi-\\ngation into RVE size in this study. We use ABAQUS 6.13 to solve the RVEs derived from Fig. 1 given the material properties', 'for each phase stated above. Kinematic uniform boundary conditions were applied to the samples: The displacement u is', 'imposed at point x at boundary S such that: ', 'u = E · x , ∀ x ⊂ S, \\nwhere E is constant and symmetrical second rank tensor that does not depend on x . The dynamic moduli are calculated in', 'the frequency-domain viscoelastic module for small strain oscillations ( Deng et al., 2012 ). ', 'In addition to the modeling framework introduced above, we also use the statistical concept of margin of error to', 'determine the minimum number of realizations required to estimate the effective properties at a desired precision.

Conclusions ', 'In this paper, we have shown a statistical approach to determine RVE size and constraints for the required number', 'of realizations to simulate a given property with the desired precision for frequency-dependent viscoelastic polymer', 'nano-composites. For the V F = 10% microstructure, all the selected volume sizes are qualified as RVEs with a sufficient\\nnumber of realizations for both volume fraction and tan δ peak estimation. The required number of realizations decreases\\nfor increasing RVE sizes due to decreasing variance as the size become larger. For mechanical properties such as the peak', 'of tan δ, the minimum realization requirements are determined by an iterative statistical method that was demonstrated\\nonly for selected examples. For the rest of the candidate RVE sizes, it is practical to only determine sufficient numbers. To', 'estimate the peak of tan δ of a well dispersed sample, V = 10 3 voxels was suggested as the optimal RVE size as a balance\\nof computation time and the processing time corresponding to the number of realizations. The use of sufficient realizations', 'of V = 10 3 voxels instead of the full RVE represents a reduction in computational time of three orders of magnitude while\\nstill achieving the desired precision. The ability to reduce computation time by several orders of magnitude will allow us to', 'rapidly fill design of experiments (DOEs) for data mining and to consider more complex microstructures where large RVEs', 'would be prohibitive in future studies.

Similarly, we found that including an interphase layer does not have a strong impact on the determination', 'of the minimum number of realizations, whereas the geometric characteristics of the microstructure appeared to have', 'a more significant influence on the results of the RVE studies. In considering a higher volume fraction ( V F = 25% ), we\\ndemonstrated that the smallest adequate RVE size is larger and that the minimum number of realizations needed to', 'estimate properties within target precision is larger at higher volume fractions.

Finally, we investigated the influence of dispersion by conducting some of the analysis on', 'a microstructure with V F = 10% with different dispersion states, showing a larger minimum RVE size and larger number of\\nrealization required to achieve the same precision with more clustering. The findings in Section 3.4 –3.7 need to be validated', 'and reevaluated when considering completely different types of materials.

', 'In order to implement this approach, using the mean of small RVEs instead of a large RVE for property prediction in', 'a given material system, with specific microstructures, properties and desired precision, it is recommended to start with', 'smaller volume sizes with reasonable numbers of realizations.

      "The semantic heterogeneity has been identified as the most important and the toughest problem when \n",

      "semantic mapping of component interface data models, Model Driven architecture (MDA) based approaches and \n",

      "Specific models (PSM), Platform Independent Model to Model (PIM2PIM), etc.[13]. On the other hand, ontology-\n",
      "based approaches within a domain organizes system knowledge in conceptual sub-domains according to its meaning. \n",
      "It addresses the semantic mapping needs by identifying, abstracting commonalities and checking for inconsistencies \n",
      "with reference to a domain ontology using a unified vocabulary of domain specific terminologies[14][15].  \n",

      "To ease the issue of semantic data heterogeneity due to the heterogeneous artifacts produced by various enterprise \n",
      "platform specific interface modelling languages in automotive domain, a unified and platform independent domain-\n",
      "specific entities vocabulary representation for various interface data models of automotive domain platform-specific \n",
      "components using ontology is the need of the hour [14]. Even in order to define a domain metamodel using an MDA \n",
      "approach for cross-platform interface data model interoperability, it is essential to have a platform independent \n",
      "reference domain model and the domain-specific entities as keywords or vocabulary associated with the domain.  \n",
      "\n",
      "XML is a standard for structuring and exchanging data between heterogeneous applications which can be carried \n",

      "2. Motivation and Contribution \n",
      "\n",
      "The automotive industry can be regarded as a complex yet connected network or ecosystem as seen in Fig. 1. \n",
      "Component frameworks with heterogeneous architectures and semantics must be integrated into collaborative \n",
      "systems of the future ECU (Electronic Control Units) high performance computing software platforms to support \n",

      "\n",
      "Ontology-driven software development is widely pursued in domain-specific application development. A major \n",

      "Match is one of the primary used tools for semantic ontology matching. They distinguish between equivalence, \n",
      "subset (is-a), overlap and mismatch correspondences and try to provide a relationship for any pair of concepts of two \n",
      "ontologies by utilizing standard match techniques [11]. Incorporating the XML and RDF paradigms approach was \n",
      "also proposed by Yin-Yang Web [9] but it did not consider any heterogeneous sources with different syntax or data \n",
      "models. They developed an integrated model for XML and RDF by integrating the semantics and inferencing rules \n",
      "of RDF into XML, so that XML querying can benefit from their RDF reasoner.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In context of domain specific global ontology, the author of [6] has proposed an ontology for automobile industry \n",
      "named as VCO (Vehicle Corporate Ontology) that would address the problems of platform and syntactic \n",
      "heterogeneity by mapping between individual schemas and XSLT transformations. The authors of [1] proposes an \n",

      "areas of possible semantic synergies [9]. Semantic mapping between the constructs of the RDFS can be achieved \n",

      "\n",
      "Road noise has been getting increased attention with the electrification of vehicles. Electric engines have drastically reduced noise \n",
      "levels compared to combustion and, therefore, the focus is shifting towards other noise sources, such as road noise. This source of noise, \n",
      "originated from the excitation that the road applies to the tire contact patch, is responsible for the structure-borne noise and vibrations \n",
      "transmitted to the vehicle interior in a frequency bandwidth up to 600 Hz. The tire and road interactions are also generating airborne \n",
      "noise contribution toward the interior noise up to higher frequencies of several kilohertz, but this contribution will not be treated in \n",
      "this paper. \n",
      "\n",
      "The tire-wheel assembly is one of the important elements in the propagation paths of road noise. Therefore, tire manufacturers are \n",
      "seeking methodologies allowing for the assessment of the performance of different construction designs during early stages of the \n",
      "development process. \n",
      "\n",
      "To accurately assess the performance of the tire-wheel on the vehicle, the road and tire interaction needs to be characterized. \n",
      "Several ways to describe this interaction have been proposed in literature. For instance, it could be characterized by means of the \n",
      "interface forces generated by the wheel at the spindle. These interface forces can be measured or indirectly estimated, using classical \n",
      "TPA (Transfer Path Analysis). Classical TPA is a reliable experimental technique that allows for the estimation of contact forces at the \n",
      "interface between a source and a receiver, and the quantification of the loads contributions [1]. This technique has been successfully \n",
      "applied to obtain spindle interface forces [2,3]. However, these loads also depend on the vehicle characteristics and cannot be applied \n",
      "to a different vehicle for NVH prediction. \n",
      "\n",
      "An alternative approach, described in [4], proposes to measure the road surface and to convert it into enforced motion at the tire \n",
      "patch. This road profile was used as an invariant input to a simulation model. Accurate finite element models of the tire are difficult to \n",
      "create since they require accurate geometry and material properties. Alternatively, a fully experimental model was used in [5], where \n",
      "the enforced tire patch motions were shown to be less dependent on the vehicle receiver than the spindle forces. It was also noted that \n",
      "the road input force still showed some dependency on the tire or suspension characteristics; therefore, it could not be transferred \n",
      "between different vehicle-tire assemblies. \n",
      "\n",
      "To obtain an accurate and reliable invariant characterization of the road and tire interaction, the concept of blocked forces can be \n",
      "considered [6–9]. The blocked forces are the interface forces that an operating source would exert on a fully constrained interface. \n",
      "According to this definition, the blocked forces can be directly measured using a load cell at the interface between the tire and a rigid \n",
      "test-rig during operation, as described in [10]. Nevertheless, this is difficult to achieve experimentally, since the loads at the interface \n",
      "will start to deviate from the actual blocked forces as the frequency approaches the modes of the rig. As a more practical experimental \n",
      "approach, it was shown by [11] that the blocked forces could be estimated using matrix inversion from measurements made in-situ at \n",
      "the connection interface, with no need to separate the involved structures. In [12], a general in-situ methodology was proposed that \n",
      "allowed for the estimation of the blocked forces using any set of degrees of freedom (DOF) of the receiver structure, not necessarily at \n",
      "the connection interface. In [13], blocked forces were estimated in-situ on a vehicle for a road noise application, and the contributions \n",
      "were compared to the ones obtained using classical TPA. One of the advantages of obtaining such invariant tire and road interaction is \n",
      "that blocked forces can also be used to perform vehicle NVH predictions when the tire is mounted on different vehicles. \n",
      "\n",
      "The in-situ estimation of blocked forces, as well as the vehicle predictions, require the FRFs of the full coupled system. These FRFs \n",
      "should be representative of the system during operational conditions. For the particular case of road noise, it has been found that the \n",
      "rolling condition of the tire-wheel affects its dynamic behavior. In [14], the effect of rolling versus non-rolling conditions of the tire \n",
      "was analyzed using measurement data and simulation. The onset of rolling was found to have an effect on the material properties and \n",
      "tire modes, which is further accentuated with the rolling speed. In [15], it was shown the importance of correcting the tire parameters \n",
      "to adequate the model to rolling conditions in order to accurately predict the axle force when the tire was connected to the suspension. \n",
      "It becomes clear that the rolling condition of the tire will have an effect on the full vehicle that might need to be considered so as to \n",
      "yield accurate vehicle predictions. In this paper, the impact that the rolling condition has on the prediction is analyzed, and experi-\n",
      "mental advice is offered to take it into account. \n",
      "\n",
      "The final goal of this paper is to validate the full component based-TPA methodology, which would allow for the virtual assembly of \n",
      "the tire to different vehicles to predict their assembled NVH behavior, considering each subsystem, source and receiver, as separate \n",
      "components [16]. A key step in this methodology is the Frequency Based Substructuring (FBS), a technique that can be applied to \n",
      "experimental (as well as numerical) models of source and receiver substructures in order to synthesize the coupled system FRFs [17]. In \n",
      "previous research [18], the FBS has been validated on a simplified tire suspension system setup in static conditions for a frequency \n",
      "range up to 250Hz. In this paper, component-based TPA will be validated on an actual vehicle. By means of FBS, structure borne noise \n",
      "will be virtually predicted from the loads identified on a tire test-rig. As a method validation, the predicted noise will be compared with \n",

      "application, highlighting the importance of the consistency between the operational conditions and the system’s noise transfer \n",
      "functions. In this sense, the effect due to the rolling of the tire was investigated. A tire under rolling conditions was characterized on a \n",
      "tire test-rig by a set of blocked forces. The identified blocked forces were then used to predict a vehicle interior noise. The results \n",
      "obtained from the prediction were in good agreement with the measurements for the frequency range of interest. The predicted noise \n",
      "levels were also obtained in time domain, allowing for auralization. This methodology would be of great value to the industry, helping \n",
      "it accelerate the component development process by allowing original equipment manufacturers and automakers to set targets on \n",
      "blocked forces, and tire manufacturers to comply with them and use them to perform tire rankings up to 600 Hz. In this regard, the \n",
      "presented research shows that there is a potential experimental applicability, and the results are expected to build trust on the \n",
      "methodology and help bring it to the industry. \n",

      "The main methodological novelty of this research resides in the identification of the effect that the rolling tire has on the vehicle \n",
      "FRFs and the guidelines offered to take it into account experimentally. It is also important that the FRFs are measured while the tire is \n",
      "rolling at the same speed as during the operation, such that both, blocked forces and FRFs, refer to the characterization of the same \n",
      "source conditions. During the presented experiments, the tire was rolling at a constant speed of 20 kph. It is then proposed as a future \n",
      "research item to explore the validity of the proposed methods while the tire is rolling at different speeds. It is worth pointing out that \n",
      "the rolling effect of the tire on the rig FRFs was found negligible due to the much higher rigidity of the rig, and, therefore, it was not \n",

In this regard, component-based TPA (Transfer Path Analysis) has been recently explored. It is a powerful methodology allowing for a virtual prototype vehicle NVH prediction starting from independent sources and component models. The aim of this paper is to analyze the potential of the component-based TPA in the context of road noise. This methodology, on one hand, allows the tire manufacturers to charac-terize their tires on a tire test-rig independently of any vehicle and, on the other hand, enables the automotive OEMs to perform the prediction of the full system vehicle behavior starting from the test-rig measurements. However, some challenges are still hindering the application of the methodology in this context. In this regard, all the component-based TPA methodology steps are investigated in this work. A slick tire, selected for this analysis, is characterized on a test-rig by a set of blocked forces, which only depend on the source. The uncoupled tire and vehicle are experimentally characterized through the measurement of their frequency-response functions (FRFs) under a static load condition. Frequency Based Substructuring (FBS) is applied to these substructures in order to synthesize the coupled vehicle FRFs. Both rear tires are coupled to the vehicle using this approach. Finally, the vehicle road noise is predicted by propagating one of the tires’ blocked forces through the synthesized full vehicle FRFs in a modular approach. The method is validated by comparison with direct vehicle measurements. Transferability of blocked forces is also assessed by direct comparison between blocked forces estimated on vehicle and test- rig. Importantly, the rolling effect is identified and considered in a direct propagation process, analyzing its implications in the vehicle noise prediction. This paper also intends to serve as a guideline to industrialize the experimental and processing steps.  * Corresponding author. E-mail address: jesus.ortega@siemens.com (J. Ortega Almirón).

Introduction Road noise has been getting increased attention with the electrification of vehicles. Electric engines have drastically reduced noise levels compared to combustion and, therefore, the focus is shifting towards other noise sources, such as road noise. This source of noise, originated from the excitation that the road applies to the tire contact patch, is responsible for the structure-borne noise and vibrations transmitted to the vehicle interior in a frequency bandwidth up to 600 Hz. The tire and road interactions are also generating airborne noise contribution toward the interior noise up to higher frequencies of several kilohertz, but this contribution will not be treated in this paper. The tire-wheel assembly is one of the important elements in the propagation paths of road noise. Therefore, tire manufacturers are seeking methodologies allowing for the assessment of the performance of different construction designs during early stages of the development process. To accurately assess the performance of the tire-wheel on the vehicle, the road and tire interaction needs to be characterized. Several ways to describe this interaction have been proposed in literature. For instance, it could be characterized by means of the interface forces generated by the wheel at the spindle. These interface forces can be measured or indirectly estimated, using classical TPA (Transfer Path Analysis). Classical TPA is a reliable experimental technique that allows for the estimation of contact forces at the interface between a source and a receiver, and the quantification of the loads contributions [1]. This technique has been successfully applied to obtain spindle interface forces [2,3]. However, these loads also depend on the vehicle characteristics and cannot be applied to a different vehicle for NVH prediction. An alternative approach, described in [4], proposes to measure the road surface and to convert it into enforced motion at the tire patch. This road profile was used as an invariant input to a simulation model. Accurate finite element models of the tire are difficult to create since they require accurate geometry and material properties. Alternatively, a fully experimental model was used in [5], where the enforced tire patch motions were shown to be less dependent on the vehicle receiver than the spindle forces. It was also noted that the road input force still showed some dependency on the tire or suspension characteristics; therefore, it could not be transferred between different vehicle-tire assemblies. To obtain an accurate and reliable invariant characterization of the road and tire interaction, the concept of blocked forces can be considered [6–9]. The blocked forces are the interface forces that an operating source would exert on a fully constrained interface. According to this definition, the blocked forces can be directly measured using a load cell at the interface between the tire and a rigid test-rig during operation, as described in [10]. Nevertheless, this is difficult to achieve experimentally, since the loads at the interface will start to deviate from the actual blocked forces as the frequency approaches the modes of the rig. As a more practical experimental approach, it was shown by [11] that the blocked forces could be estimated using matrix inversion from measurements made in-situ at the connection interface, with no need to separate the involved structures. In [12], a general in-situ methodology was proposed that allowed for the estimation of the blocked forces using any set of degrees of freedom (DOF) of the receiver structure, not necessarily at the connection interface. In [13], blocked forces were estimated in-situ on a vehicle for a road noise application, and the contributions were compared to the ones obtained using classical TPA. One of the advantages of obtaining such invariant tire and road interaction is that blocked forces can also be used to perform vehicle NVH predictions when the tire is mounted on different vehicles. The in-situ estimation of blocked forces, as well as the vehicle predictions, require the FRFs of the full coupled system. These FRFs should be representative of the system during operational conditions. For the particular case of road noise, it has been found that the rolling condition of the tire-wheel affects its dynamic behavior. In [14], the effect of rolling versus non-rolling conditions of the tire was analyzed using measurement data and simulation. The onset of rolling was found to have an effect on the material properties and tire modes, which is further accentuated with the rolling speed. In [15], it was shown the importance of correcting the tire parameters to adequate the model to rolling conditions in order to accurately predict the axle force when the tire was connected to the suspension. It becomes clear that the rolling condition of the tire will have an effect on the full vehicle that might need to be considered so as to yield accurate vehicle predictions. In this paper, the impact that the rolling condition has on the prediction is analyzed, and experi-mental advice is offered to take it into account. The final goal of this paper is to validate the full component based-TPA methodology, which would allow for the virtual assembly of the tire to different vehicles to predict their assembled NVH behavior, considering each subsystem, source and receiver, as separate components [16]. A key step in this methodology is the Frequency Based Substructuring (FBS), a technique that can be applied to experimental (as well as numerical) models of source and receiver substructures in order to synthesize the coupled system FRFs [17]. In previous research [18], the FBS has been validated on a simplified tire suspension system setup in static conditions for a frequency range up to 250Hz. In this paper, component-based TPA will be validated on an actual vehicle. By means of FBS, structure borne noise will be virtually predicted from the loads identified on a tire test-rig. As a method validation, the predicted noise will be compared with the measured vehicle interior noise. 2. Theoretical background In this section, the theoretical background involved in the component-based transfer path analysis methodology is presented. Section 2.1 will cover the basic Frequency Based Substructuring formulation in its dual form. Apart from its experimental application and validation in section 3.3, it will also serve to build the additional concepts of section 2.2. In section 2.2, the principles of source characterization will be described, especially regarding an enforced displacement on the source, which will be the case for the road J. Ortega Almirón et al.

Finally, in section 2.3, the geometrical reduction, or Virtual Point Transformation, will be explained. 2.1. Frequency Based Substructuring Frequency Based Substructuring (FBS) [19–21] is a dynamic substructuring method that can be employed to obtain the frequency response functions of a coupled system from the response functions of the separate subsystems. Since FBS permits the synthesis of the full system FRFs without physically coupling the subsystems, it becomes valuable in early stages of the developing process when only few prototypes are available and for some components only numerical models are accessible. Let us take the model shown in Fig. 1. In this model, there are depicted two separate subsystems, source and receiver. A set of external forces, denoted by f(ω), is applied on the subsystems. The interaction between the subsystems is modeled by the introduction of an additional set of forces, g(ω), representing the internal forces applied on the connection degrees of freedom of the subsystems. The applied forces generate a set of responses, denoted by u(ω). f, g and u represent complex amplitudes in frequency domain but, for simplicity, the explicit dependency on the frequency will be omitted for every magnitude for the rest of this paper. The described system is assumed linear, and its behavior is modeled using a set of frequency response functions, H. The behavior of the system can be represented by, u =⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣uSsuScuRcuRr⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦=⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣HSssHScs00HSscHScc0000HRccHRrc00HRcrHRrr⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦⎛⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣fSsfScfRcfRr⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦+⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣0gScgRc0⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦⎞⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠= H(f + g), (1)  where the superscript indicates the subsystem (S: source; R: receiver) and the subscript indicates the set of degrees of freedom (c: connection; s: source; r: receiver). When the subsystems are coupled through the connection degrees of freedom, c, the responses at the connection will be equal, satisfying the compatibility condition, described by, uSc = uRc → Bu = 0, (2)  where B is a signed Boolean matrix that maps the DOFs to satisfy the compatibility condition: B = [ 0 − I I 0 ]. (3) The enforcement of the compatibility is guaranteed by the internal forces, g, which in turn need to satisfy the law of action and reaction: gSc = − gRc → g = BTλ, (4)  where λ are the Lagrange multipliers associated with the connection loads of the assembly. Substituting in Eq. (1) the definition of g given in Eq. (4), and then substituting that on u in Eq. (2), an expression for λ can be explicitly obtained as, λ = −(BHBT)− 1BHf. (5) Expressing g using the above definition of λ and substituting it on Eq. (1), the dual assembly formulation of the Frequency Based Substructuring equation is obtained [22]. The coupled system FRFs, HSR, can be directly expressed in function of the originally decoupled subsystems FRFs, H: HSR = H − HBT(BHBT)− 1BH. (6) Expanding this equation: Fig. 1. Subsystems assembly model.  J.

(7) Writing the expression corresponding to the first column and fourth row of HSR: HSRrs = HRrc(HScc + HRcc)− 1HScs, (8)  which represents the coupled system FRFs between an arbitrary DOF on the source and an arbitrary DOF on the receiver. 2.2. Source characterization In this section, source characterization refers to the quantitative identification of the source’s operational conditions when it is coupled to a passive receiver. A review of methods and underlying theory can be found in [16,23]. Let us refer to a general system, depicted in Fig. 2, which is composed of an active component, the source, and a fully passive component, the receiver. The operation of the source is provided by its internal excitation mechanism, fi, acting on the internal DOFs i. The operation of the source is then characterized by this internal excitation, which may depend on both source and receiver. However, it is usually unfeasible in practice to access or measure this internal excitation. Another possibility to represent the operational conditions would be the set of interface forces, gSc , exerted at the connection with the receiver. Nevertheless, the interface forces depend also on the receiver and are, therefore, not an invariant source characterization. Two types of source’s internal mechanisms are treated in this section: a mechanism in which the internal force is invariant, and a mechanism in which the internal displacement is invariant. These will be theoretically treated in detail in the following subsections. In these cases, blocked forces can be used to characterize the source [24]. By definition, blocked forces, fbl, are the set of interface forces that the source would exert on an infinitely rigid constraint at the connection [8]. In this blocked configuration, the particular internal forces, fi, acting on the source will be denoted by fSi , to highlight the dependency on the source only. The blocked forces can be theoretically derived using their definition. In this configuration, the connections of the source are blocked, and two forces are acting: the blocked forces at the connections, and the internal forces generated by the source, fSi (Fig. 3, left). Enforcing no displacement at the connection, the blocked forces can be expressed as: 0 = HScifSi − HSccfbl → fbl = HS− 1cc HScifSi . (9) Since the connection would be rigidly constrained, the receiver attached to it would not affect the blocked forces. This implies that the blocked forces are a source characterization independent of the receiver. Due to this definition, when negative blocked forces are acting simultaneously to the source’s internal mechanism operation, the connection interface and every receiver attached to it will remain static (see Fig. 3, right): Fig. 2. Operating source connected to a fully passive receiver.  Fig. 3. Operating source connected to a rigid constraint (left). Blocked forces and source mechanism acting simultaneously (right).  J. Ortega Almirón et al.                                                                                                                                                                                              Journal of Sound and Vibration 523 (2022) 11669450 = HSRri fSi − HSRrc fbl. (10)  2.2.1. Invariant internal force In case that the internal force, fi, is assumed to be invariant, it will be the same for every coupled receiver, and also equal to fSi . In this case, the responses at the receiver are given by: uRr = HSRri fSi . (11) If blocked forces are acting on an assembly together with the operating source, the responses at the receiver will be zero as explained before (Eq. (10)), which implies that, HSRrc fbl = HSRri fSi = HSRri fi = uRr . (12) This leads to an important observation, i.e., that the blocked forces, fbl, related to an invariant source load, fSi , generate the same responses on the attached receiver as the source’s internal mechanism (see Fig. 4). Blocked forces can therefore be transferred to make predictions on different receivers. Another consequence of this is that it allows for the in-situ estimation of the blocked forces [12,25] from Eq. (12), according to, fbl = HSR+rc uRr , (13)  as long as there are enough responses, uRr , for HSRrc to be full rank. However, it is often recommended in practice to keep a certain degree of overdetermination, so the blocked forces can be estimated in a least squares sense, in which case the pseudoinverse, *+, is used. These implications can also be theoretically shown using the FBS equations. Particularizing Eq. (8) for the internal DOFs of the source: HSRri = HRrc(HScc + HRcc)− 1HSci. (14) Combining Eq. (14) and (11), the responses on the receiver due to the operating source are given by: uRr = HRrc(HScc + HRcc)− 1HScifSi . (15) Finally, using Eq. (9): uRr = HRrc(HScc + HRcc)− 1HSccfbl = HSRrc fbl. (16) This shows that the blocked forces can generate the same responses in the receiver as the invariant internal loads. 2.2.2. Invariant internal displacement Most sources can be assumed to behave with an internal mechanism that imposes an internal force that is invariant, so it does not depend on the receiver that the sources are attached to. However, some sources, such as a tire excited by the road, can be better modeled assuming that the invariant source mechanism is a set of enforced displacements, uSi , which could, for instance, represent the displacement originated by the road profile, and not modeled by a set of invariant loads at the tire patch, which are dependent on the vehicle [5]. In this case, it is the displacement imposed by the road, due to its high rigidity compared to the tire-vehicle assembly, what is invariant. The model for a system with a source in which the internal displacement is enforced is depicted in Fig. 5. To obtain the blocked forces for this source, we can look at the theoretical definition of the blocked forces in Fig. 6, left, where the source is operating while attached to an infinitely rigid constraint. In this case, the displacements are enforced at two locations, the connections and the internal excitation DOFs. First, imposing uSi : uSi = HSiifSi − HSicfbl → fSi = HS− 1ii(uSi +HSicfbl). (17) Substituting this expression of fSi in Eq. (9), the blocked forces are derived for this type of source: Fig. 4. Blocked forces generate the same responses on the receiver as the source mechanism.  J. Ortega Almirón et al.                                                                                                                                                                                              Journal of Sound and Vibration 523 (2022) 1166946fbl =(HScc − HSciHSii− 1HSic)− 1HSciHS− 1ii uSi . (18) In this type of source, in which an invariant displacement, uSi , is enforced, the internal forces, fi, depend in general on the receiver attached to the source according to: fi = HSR− 1ii uSi . (19) Therefore, fi are not invariant. These, in the road noise analogy, would represent the contact forces at the tire patch. In fact, the responses at the receiver in this case are given by: uRr = HSRri fi = HSRri HSR− 1ii uSi . (20) This has some implications on the in-situ estimation of blocked forces: for the defined model, Eq. (13) cannot be directly used to estimate the blocked forces using HSRrc FRFs. Using HSRrc FRFs in Eq. (13), and simplifying the expression using FBS relations (Eq. (8)) would lead to the following expression for estimated loads: HSR+rc HSRri HSR− 1ii uSi = HS− 1cc HSciHSR− 1ii uSi ∕= fbl, (21)  which is not equal to the actual expression for blocked forces of Eq. (18) and actually exhibits a dependency on the receiver FRFs. In order to obtain the right blocked forces in-situ and propagate them to make predictions on other receiver structures, the source substructure’s FRFs need to include an additional constraint of the internal DOFs, i. This is depicted in Fig. 7 and consists in attaching the internal DOFs of the source to an infinitely rigid constraint. The source with blocked internal DOFs will be denoted by S′to distinguish it from the original source, S. This additional constraint can be intuitively understood as the mobilities HS′Rii becoming zero, so the effect of any attached receiver R becomes negligible. The internal forces required to impose uSi on that blocked system would then be theoretically infinitely (very) Fig. 5. Operating source mechanism modeled as an enforced displacement while the source is attached to an arbitrary receiver.  Fig. 6. Operating source mechanism modeled as an enforced displacement. Operating source connected to a rigid constraint (left). Blocked forces and source mechanism acting simultaneously (right). Fig. 7. Blocked forces acting on the system with blocked internal DOFs generate the same responses on the receiver as the source invariant mechanism. J. Ortega Almirón et al.                                                                                                                                                                                              Journal of Sound and Vibration 523 (2022) 1166947large and become invariant, like in the case of a structure attached to the ground during an earthquake. This would imply that using HS′Rrc FRFs in Eq. (13) would properly estimate the correct blocked forces in-situ, and the case would be analogous to the one treated in section 2.2.1. These blocked forces could therefore be transferred to a different assembly and used for prediction, as long as the FRFs of the assembly contain the blocking constraint of source S′. For a general system, with FRFs HSRii , the internal forces are not physically infinite but the behavior of the system in operation would be equivalent, since the enforced displacement, uSi , is the same. Therefore, the blocked forces acting on a system with source S′generate the same responses on the receiver, R, as the original source, S, operating alone. Apart from the intuitive explanation, a theoretical justification can be derived. With the following equations it will be proven that the blocked forces, fbl, can be estimated in-situ using Eq. (13) with the FRFs of the system with blocked internal DOFs, HS′Rrc : fbl = HS′R+rc uRr . (22) Substituting here the measured operational responses from Eq. (20): fbl = HS′R+rc HSRri HSR− 1ii uSi .

(7), is applied here to express the coupled FRFs using the decoupled source and receiver FRFs: fbl = HS′cc− 1(HS′cc + HRcc)HRrc+⏟̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅⏞⏞̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅⏟HS′ Rrc+HRrc(HScc + HRcc)− 1HSci⏟̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅⏞⏞̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅⏟HSRri[HSii − HSic(HScc + HRcc)− 1HSci]− 1⏟̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅⏞⏞̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅⏟HSRii− 1uSi . (24) In this equation, HS′cc FRFs can be expressed in terms of the FRFs of S by enforcing the blocking constraint at i (or using FBS, Eq. (7), to attach a mobility of zero to i): HS′cc = HScc − HSciHS− 1ii HSic. (25) Manipulating Eq. (24) and including Eq.

Furthermore, this is the same expression for the blocked forces as derived from the definition in Eq. (18). The blocked forces estimated in-situ using Eq. (22) are therefore invariant. Fig. 8. Schematic overview of the system representing the blocked forces propagation for the case of road noise.  J. Ortega Almirón et al.                                                                                                                                                                                              Journal of Sound and Vibration 523 (2022) 1166948The main practical implication from this occurs when experimentally measuring the coupled FRFs for the in-situ estimation of blocked forces. In this case, it is required that the DOFs i are effectively blocked. For the case of road noise, this constraint is naturally guaranteed when the FRFs are measured with the tire patch contacting the road surface and not in operation, as depicted in Fig. 8. The same assumption needs to be considered when characterizing the uncoupled tire for the coupling exercise using the FBS. In this case, the uncoupled tire has to be preloaded on the ground and not suspended in free-free. 2.3. Virtual Point Transformation The Virtual Point Transformation is a method that allows for the measurement of excitation and responses at degrees of freedom that cannot be directly accessed, using measurements at alternative DOFs under certain conditions. The method relies on the assumption that the region around the measured DOFs is rigid. Methods that rely on the use of rigid behavior assumption to measure inaccessible DOFs have been extensively documented in the literature [26–30]. In this way, a rigid geometrical reduction of the measured DOFs is performed to the center of reduction. The application of this method has been well documented in literature and also applied for the estimation of spindle forces on road noise applications [2]. In Fig. 9, a region assumed to be rigid is depicted. Different excitations, f, and responses, u, are measured around the region. The six rigid body response DOFs of the center of reduction, q, can be related to any measured response, uj, using the geometrical information, by the following equation: uj =⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣ex,jey,jez,jry,jez,j − rz,jey,jrz,jex,j − rx,jez,jrx,jey,j − ry,jex,j⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦T⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣qxqyqzqRxqRyqRz⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦= Rjq, (27)  where the matrix Rj is a row vector that contains the geometrical information of the measured DOF j, i.e., the coordinates, rj, and the orientation projections, ej. An analogous relation can be established between every measured excitation, fi, and the six reduced rigid body loads, m, using: m =⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣mxmymzmRxmRymRz⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦= RiTfi. (28) The behavior of the rigid body DOFs of the structure can be represented, using the FRFs, by q = Hqmm. (29) Enforcing Eq. (27) and (28), Eq. (29) becomes: uj = RjHqmRiTfi = Hjifi. (30) Increasing the number of measured excitations and responses, u =⎡⎣⋮uj⋮⎤⎦ =⎡⎣⋮Rj⋮⎤⎦Hqm[⋯ RiT ⋯]⎡⎣⋮fi⋮⎤⎦ = RuHqmRf Tf = Huff. (31) If the number of measured excitations and responses and their geometry allow the matrices Ru and Rf to be rank 6, the FRFs for the Fig. 9. Virtual Point Transformation model.  J. Ortega Almirón et al.                                                                                                                                                                                              Journal of Sound and Vibration 523 (2022) 1166949reduced DOFs, Hqm, can be obtained in a least squares sense from the FRFs of the measured DOFs, Huf , using the pseudoinverses of the matrices R: Hqm = (Ru)+Huf(Rf T)+. (32) This method can become valuable in the context of FBS, as it allows for the estimation of linear and rotational FRFs at the exact connection locations of both substructures. Moreover, for source characterization, this method can be applied to the excitations in order to obtain the blocked forces at the specific interface. 3. Experimental case study In this section, the component-based TPA methodology is applied and demonstrated in the context of predicting full vehicle road noise. This research focuses on structure-borne road noise transmitted to the interior of the vehicle, for which a frequency range of 50 to 600 Hz is investigated. The measurements were performed using a Simcenter Qsources integral shaker for the excitations and a Simcenter Scadas for the data acquisition. In section 3.1 the tire-wheel, considered as the active source of the system, will be char-acterized in operation by means of blocked forces identified at the wheel center. In section 3.2, the source will be transferred to the vehicle by propagating the blocked forces through the measured coupled FRFs. In section 3.3, dynamic substructuring will be applied between the vehicle and the rear tires before the blocked forces propagation. Finally, in section 3.4 the rolling effect on the vehicle FRFs will be explored and an experimental solution will be provided. All measured and predicted interior sound pressure levels are shown weighted in dB(A). A schematic summary of the experimental study is shown in Fig. 10. <120 HzFig. 10. Summary of experimental steps and validations of the study.  J.

Journal of Sound and Vibration 523 (2022) 116694103.1. Tire characterization on a test-rig The source under investigation consists in a slick tire-wheel on a drum (subsystem A). The tire-wheel was mounted on a rigid test- rig as the passive receiver (subsystem B). When the tire is mounted on the actual vehicle, the weight of the car affects the deformation of the tire rubber and the contact patch with the road. To represent the same conditions as on the vehicle, a representative static load of 2864 N was applied to the tire on the rig. The tire-wheel was rigidly connected to the rolling part of the rig using five bolted joints. A bearing placed between the rolling and static parts of the rig allowed for the free rotation of the tire, driven only by the drum. A set of eight triaxial accelerometers were placed on the static part of the rig to be used as indicators for the estimation of the blocked forces. A schematic view of the setup is shown in Fig. 11. The interface between source and receiver was modeled as a rigid connection. To account for linear and rotational degrees of freedom, 12 excitations in different directions were applied on the center of the wheel, nearby the actual connection interface (Fig. 11, right). For this purpose, four lightweight aluminum extension blocks were screwed to four of the five bolted joints. It was assumed that the added structures were light and rigid enough compared to the full system to properly transmit the excitations to the interface and obtain representative FRFs for the frequency range of interest. The FRFs of the coupled system were measured using a shaker placed on each of the 12 excitation locations with the tire in static conditions. The excitations were then geometrically reduced to the center of the connection using the Virtual Point Transformation. Since there was a bearing that allowed a free rotation of the tire, the rotational DOF aligned with the rotation, Ry, was excluded from the FRF matrix inputs, therefore, a total of five DOFs (x, y, z, Rx, Rz) were considered at the coupling point. A set of FRFs was identified in this process: the accelerances between the interface excitations and the indicators at the passive side (HABrc ∈ C24×5). During operating conditions, a rough coating was used on the drum to act as the road profile. The accelerations at indicators (aABr ∈ C24×1) locations were measured while the drum was rolling at a constant speed of 20 kph during 200 s. The blocked forces (fABbl ∈ C5×1) corresponding to these operating conditions were estimated in-situ [12,31] using the indicators accelerations, according to: fABbl =(HABrc)+aABr . (33) The blocked forces were estimated in time domain using the accelerometers’ time data. Since they were in time domain, the averaged autopower spectrum [32] is depicted in Fig. 12. In order to validate the invariability hypothesis, these blocked forces will be compared later with the ones estimated in-situ from the vehicle. For road noise applications at low frequencies, the direct measurement of blocked forces, according to its definition on a highly rigid tire test-rig, can be an effective option. Nonetheless, as the frequency approaches the first resonance mode of the rig, the measured interface forces will diverge from the actual blocked forces. It is then recommended to estimate blocked forces in-situ, especially for higher frequencies, as it is performed in this section. Fig. 11. Schematic depiction of the rig plus tire.  J.

Journal of Sound and Vibration 523 (2022) 116694123.2. Vehicle noise prediction from blocked forces identified on the rig combined with experimentally measured coupled FRFs The blocked forces estimated in-situ on the rig were then transferred to a different receiver for further validation and to assess the prediction capabilities. The new receiver was an actual vehicle (subsystem C). The FRFs required for the transferability of blocked forces were the coupled system FRFs (system AC). The same tire used in the rig was mounted on the rear right side of the vehicle, on the same drum and road profile. The considered targets were two microphones placed in the vehicle interior: one on the driver seat and one on the rear left passenger seat. The vehicle/wheel interface was modeled as a rigid connection. The wheel was mounted on the vehicle and four extension blocks were screwed to the rim, following the same approach as for the setup in Section 3.1. During the acquisition of the coupled FRFs, an additional low frequency excitation was applied on the vehicle, such that a displacement was enforced on the suspension. This displacement amplitude was enforced to be representative of the displacement the vehicle suspension was subjected to during operational conditions. The reason for this is to avoid a non-linear behavior of the suspension, which would affect the FRFs, especially the lower frequencies. This is due to the dry friction of the shock absorbers of the suspension, that causes their behavior to switch between stick and slip condition [33]. For the coupled FRFs measurement, 12 excitations in different directions were applied on the blocks, and later geometrically reduced to the center of the interface (Fig. 13). As can be deducted from the excitation’s configuration setup, the coupled FRFs were measured in static condition while the tire was not rolling. As well as for the rig, it was assumed that the added structures did not modify the system of study for the desired frequency range. To assess the rigidity of the interface, the Reference Rigidity Index (consistency, or rigidness [23]) was applied to the measured FRFs and the average for all the responses is shown in Fig. 14. An average Reference Rigidity Index above 0.95 was obtained for most of the frequency range of interest, indicating a rigid behavior of blocks and interface. After reducing the FRFs and excluding Ry, the FRFs between the targets and the coupling interface excitations were obtained (HACtc ∈ C2×5). The target responses (aACt ∈ C2×1) were measured during the same operational conditions as on the rig, i.e., with the right tire on the rough coating of the drum rolling at a constant speed of 20 kph. The transferability of the blocked forces was performed by propagating the blocked forces estimated on the rig through the vehicle measured FRFs, according to Eq. (34), to compute the pre-dicted targets. aACt,p = HACtc fABbl . (34) A comparison between the predicted and measured sound pressure level of the microphone at the driver seat is shown in Fig. 15. Although the achieved agreement is good for most of the frequency range of interest, a higher overestimation around 95 Hz can be observed. It will be later shown that this is an effect due to the rolling condition of the tire. 3.3. Vehicle noise prediction from blocked forces identified on the rig combined with coupled FRFs obtained from FBS For the application of FBS, the uncoupled systems FRFs were required. In this regard, tire-wheel and vehicle FRFs were charac-terized separately. For the uncoupled tire-wheel FRFs measurements, a tire setup available at the engineering facility of Siemens in Leuven was used to apply the representative static load. Twelve excitations were located on four aluminum blocks glued to the inner side of the wheel. Four triaxial accelerometers were glued on the same interface. This setup is shown in Fig. 16. The acquired FRFs were geometrically reduced at the coupling point located at the center of the wheel for both excitation and responses. The tire interface was then char-acterized by the FRF matrix, HAcc ∈ C6×6. Additional preprocessing steps were carried out on these FRFs regarding the symmetry of the tire with respect to the YZ plane. This symmetry would imply that some of the entries of the FRFs matrix are zero. Since the measured values cannot be exactly zero, they were enforced to be zero, which would also simplify the coupling model. In this way it would not matter if the tire’s FRFs are mathematically rotated or mirrored before being coupled to the other side, which otherwise would imply Fig. 13. Rear right side excitations for coupled FRFs measurements.  J. Ortega Almirón et al.                                                                                                                                                                                              Journal of Sound and Vibration 523 (2022) 11669413an additional arbitrary decision. For the uncoupled vehicle FRFs measurement, both rear tires were removed. The vehicle was supported by the front tires and hanging in free-free on the rear sides. Elastic bungees were employed on each rear side to suspend the vehicle from the hub. In this way, the vehicle suspension was still compressed under the actual vehicle weight while achieving free-free conditions. For the FRFs exci-tations, four aluminum blocks were screwed to the hub, where 12 shaker locations were placed. Four triaxial accelerometers were glued on the interface to capture the connection responses. The setup is shown in Fig. 17. The defined targets were the same as in section 3.2. During the FRF measurements, as for the coupled vehicle, an additional low frequency excitation was applied to enforce on the suspension the same displacement the vehicle suspension is subjected to during operational conditions. After the FRF measurements and the Virtual Point Transformation of the interface excitations and responses, two sets of FRFs were obtained: the accelerances between the coupling interface excitations and responses (HCcc ∈ C12×12); and the FRFs between the target responses and the coupling interface excitations (HCtc ∈ C2×12). Before applying FBS, in order to couple the same tire model to both rear sides of the vehicle, the FRF matrix was duplicated and mirrored. In this way, the source FRF matrix contained both rear tires (HAcc ∈ C12×12) properly oriented to match the vehicle connection DOFs. FBS was applied between source and receiver FRFs according to: Fig. 14. Averaged Reference Rigidity Index for wheel center excitations.  Fig. 15. Driver seat microphone signal, measured vs predicted noise obtained from blocked forces combined with experimental coupled FRFs.  J. Ortega Almirón et al.                                                                                                                                                                                              Journal of Sound and Vibration 523 (2022) 11669414HACtc,FBS = HCtc(HCcc + HAcc)− 1HAcc. (35) In Fig. 18, comparison between measured and FBS synthesized FRFs is shown, for the FRFs between excitations at the rear wheel on the right side and the driver seat microphone. A generally good agreement can be found, although some errors still appear due to the sensitivity of FBS to error propagation [34,35]. The following step is the vehicle interior noise prediction. It was performed by propagating the blocked forces estimated on the rig through the FBS synthesized vehicle FRFs using: aACt,FBS,p = HACtc,FBSfABbl . (36) In this equation, the FRF matrix only contains the elements corresponding to the rear right side, in order to perform a consistent comparison through the different experimental steps. A comparison between the predicted and measured sound pressure level at the driver seat microphone is shown in Fig. 19. It can be noted that the agreement between the curves is similar to the one shown in section 3.2 (Fig. 15), including the overestimation around 95 Hz, which will be treated more in detail in section 3.4. 3.4. The rolling effect on the coupled system FRFs As discussed in the Introduction, the FRFs of a tire-wheel depend not only on the static structure, but also on the rolling condition [36]. Since the tire is coupled to the vehicle during the rolling condition, it is possible that an effect on the tire FRFs affects as well the full vehicle FRFs. The approach presented in section 3.2 for coupled vehicle FRFs measurement was applied in non-rolling condition, excluding the effect that the rolling tire might have on the vehicle FRFs. In order to measure the vehicle coupled FRFs during rolling conditions, an alternative approach was explored, i.e., to use the interior side of the knuckle to place the excitations. The setup is depicted in Fig. 20. The right rear knuckle was instrumented with nine excitation locations on different parts of the structure. Some aluminum blocks were glued to provide excitations on different directions. The measurement of the FRFs was performed while the tire was rolling on the smooth coated surface of the drum in order to avoid Fig. 16. Uncoupled tire-wheel setup for FRFs measurement.  Fig. 17. Uncoupled vehicle setup for FRFs measurement.  J. Ortega Almirón et al.

Ortega Almirón et al.                                                                                                                                                                                              Journal of Sound and Vibration 523 (2022) 11669416excessive external noise uncorrelated with the shaker inputs. The drum rolling speed was set to 20 kph, which was the same speed used during operation. The measured FRFs were geometrically reduced to the same interface center. The Reference Rigidity Index for the excitations on the knuckle is shown in Fig. 21. Despite the larger distances and more challenging geometry of the knuckle region, an averaged Reference Rigidity Index above 0.95 is obtained for the whole frequency range, indicating a similar degree of rigidness as the wheel center. However, the main drawback of this approach is that the region of excitation is further away from the actual coupling interface and is thus a potentially different structure from the wheel center one. In order to test whether the knuckle and wheel center excitations belong to the same rigid region, the FRFs using knuckle exci-tations were also measured in non-rolling condition and the Reference Rigidity Index was applied to all the excitations (nine at the knuckle plus 12 at the wheel center). The average for the responses is shown in Fig. 22. It can be observed that the Reference Rigidity Index remains above 0.9 for the lower frequencies up to around 150 Hz, from where it drops increasingly towards higher frequencies. This means that the rigidity between the excitations is lost from around 150 Hz. Since both individual regions involved, wheel center and knuckle, show a high Reference Rigidity Index separately, the observed drop of Fig. 22 cannot be caused by a local flexibility in any of those regions. Furthermore, geometry errors or faulty measurements could also be discarded as a reason, since they would imply a low Reference Rigidity Index in the lower frequencies as well. It is therefore suggested that above 150 Hz the knuckle and wheel center regions do not behave as one rigid region, which might be caused by flexibilities introduced by the additional structures in between, such as the wheel hub bearing assembly. In addition, an FRF comparison between a wheel center and a knuckle excitation is shown in Fig. 23. Similar FRFs can be observed up to around 150 Hz, from which larger deviations occur towards higher frequencies. This Fig. 19.

Ortega Almirón et al.                                                                                                                                                                                              Journal of Sound and Vibration 523 (2022) 11669417comparison supports the hypothesis that wheel center and knuckle behave as different rigid regions for higher frequencies, above around 150 Hz. Regarding the identification of the rolling effect on the vehicle FRFs, a comparison between rolling and non-rolling measured FRFs using knuckle excitations is performed. To better highlight the differences, four additional indicators were placed at different locations in the vicinity of the knuckle. A comparison between static and rolling condition FRFs to these indicators is shown in Fig. 24. A clear mismatch can be observed on the frequency range 80-100 Hz, mostly in the form of a frequency shift. A similar mismatch can be found on other FRFs, being especially noticeable for indicators closer to the excitation. Since the only difference on the setup between these FRFs sets was the rolling condition, it could be assumed that the discrepancies between 80 and 100 Hz are due to the rolling condition of the tire at 20 kph. It is also worth noting that above 150 Hz no clear differences are observed, suggesting that the non-rolling FRFs would be equally representative of the model for higher frequencies. Finally, the vehicle interior noise prediction was then performed using the coupled FRFs measured under rolling condition. The blocked forces identified in-situ on the rig were propagated through the measured vehicle coupled FRFs using Eq. (34), where HACtc now represents the coupled FRFs obtained by shaker excitations located at the suspension knuckle while the tire was rolling at 20 kph. In Fig. 25, the measured interior microphone is compared with the predictions obtained by transferring blocked forces from the rig and propagating them through both, wheel center and knuckle excited FRFs. It can be observed that, between 80-100 Hz, the quality of the prediction improves by using the FRFs measured using knuckle excitation under rolling condition compared to the wheel hub in non- rolling condition. In particular the +5 dB overestimation that is observed in that frequency range using static coupled FRFs is corrected when using coupled FRFs measured under rolling condition. It is also noticeable that above 120 Hz much larger errors are obtained Fig. 21. Averaged Reference Rigidity Index, or rigidness, for knuckle excitations.  Fig. 22. Averaged Reference Rigidity Index for wheel center plus knuckle excitations.  J. Ortega Almirón et al.

Comparison between rolling vs non-rolling FRFs using knuckle excitation.  J. Ortega Almirón et al.                                                                                                                                                                                              Journal of Sound and Vibration 523 (2022) 11669419using the knuckle FRFs. Taking into account the remarks previously made, it can be concluded that above 120 Hz the knuckle is not representative of the coupling interface behavior, and, therefore, the wheel center should be used as a location for the shaker excitation. This is coherent with the physical setup, since the wheel center blocks are bolted through the actual coupling interface. Nevertheless, considering that below 120 Hz both regions are representative of the coupling interface, using the coupled rolling FRFs measured from the knuckle will yield a more accurate vehicle model during the actual operational conditions. Taking this into consideration, a new set of coupled FRFs is obtained by merging the FRFs measured from the center wheel and the knuckle in the following way:  - Up to 100 Hz, the coupled FRFs are measured from knuckle excitations while the tire was rolling at 20 kph.  - Above 120 Hz, the coupled FRFs are measured from the wheel center excitations (non-rolling).  - Between 100 and 120 Hz, a linear transition between both coupled FRFs sets is considered. In Fig. 26, the prediction of interior noise levels is shown by propagating the blocked forces obtained in-situ on the rig, through the merged vehicle coupled FRFs. It is worth noting that the predicted noise obtained using the merged vehicle FRFs is the closest to the vehicle measured noise levels, particularly in the frequency range where the rolling tire phenomenon influences the coupled system FRFs. These results validate the previous hypotheses and the presented component-based TPA methodology for structure-borne road noise prediction. Concluding, using the new set of merged vehicle’s coupled FRFs, an additional validation was performed by assessing the hy-pothesis of invariability of the blocked forces. By definition, the blocked forces are supposed to be a characteristic of the tire-wheel and therefore independent of any receiver structure. Therefore, the blocked forces estimated in-situ on the vehicle were compared with the blocked forces estimated in-situ on the tire test-rig, as shown in section 3.1. The vehicle was equipped with four triaxial accelerometers placed on each rear side, near the knuckles, to be used as indicators for the matrix inversion. The indicators and target responses were measured during the same operational conditions as on the rig, i.e., with the right tire on the rough coating of the drum rolling at a constant speed of 20 kph. Fig. 27 compares three sets of blocked forces obtained in-situ: i) on the rig, ii) on the vehicle using wheel center coupled FRFs, and iii) on the vehicle using the merged coupled FRFs. Considering the rig blocked forces as the reference, it can be deduced that using the rolling information present in the merged vehicle FRFs, a more accurate estimation of the blocked forces in-situ can be obtained. This comparison also validates the transferability of blocked forces between the two structures. Fig. 25.

Conclusions This paper aims to validate the component-based transfer path analysis methodology on a vehicle structure-borne road noise application, highlighting the importance of the consistency between the operational conditions and the system’s noise transfer functions. In this sense, the effect due to the rolling of the tire was investigated. A tire under rolling conditions was characterized on a tire test-rig by a set of blocked forces. The identified blocked forces were then used to predict a vehicle interior noise. The results obtained from the prediction were in good agreement with the measurements for the frequency range of interest. The predicted noise levels were also obtained in time domain, allowing for auralization. This methodology would be of great value to the industry, helping it accelerate the component development process by allowing original equipment manufacturers and automakers to set targets on blocked forces, and tire manufacturers to comply with them and use them to perform tire rankings up to 600 Hz. In this regard, the presented research shows that there is a potential experimental applicability, and the results are expected to build trust on the methodology and help bring it to the industry. The main methodological novelty of this research resides in the identification of the effect that the rolling tire has on the vehicle FRFs and the guidelines offered to take it into account experimentally. It is also important that the FRFs are measured while the tire is rolling at the same speed as during the operation, such that both, blocked forces and FRFs, refer to the characterization of the same source conditions. During the presented experiments, the tire was rolling at a constant speed of 20 kph. It is then proposed as a future research item to explore the validity of the proposed methods while the tire is rolling at different speeds. It is worth pointing out that the rolling effect of the tire on the rig FRFs was found negligible due to the much higher rigidity of the rig, and, therefore, it was not considered in the experiments, i.e., only rig FRFs with the tire not rolling were used. Frequency Based Substructuring was also explored and validated in this context. Similar vehicle interior noise predictions were obtained by transferring the blocked forces from the test-rig to the vehicle using coupled vehicle FRFs, experimentally measured or synthesized using FBS, proving that the substructuring step for these structures is remarkably not adding a notable distortion to the prediction. One of the limitations of the presented approach to account for the rolling effect resides precisely on the FBS application: the uncoupled tire FRFs are measured while the tire is not rolling; therefore, the FBS synthesized vehicle coupled FRFs are also not including the rolling effect of the tire. Some future research items can be suggested to overcome the mentioned limitations. In order to Fig. 27. Blocked forces estimated in-situ using rig vs vehicle wheel center vs vehicle merged FRFs.  J.

Journal of Sound and Vibration 523 (2022) 11669422account for the rolling effect in FBS, a numerical model could be employed to obtain the uncoupled tire FRFs under rolling conditions, leading to a hybrid FBS approach. An alternative experimental approach would consist of performing a substructuring decoupling [37], in which FBS is applied to subtract the receiver FRFs from the full system FRFs in order to obtain the tire-wheel impedance matrix under rolling conditions.
