      " The solution was tested with EHWA Air and Travel Agency, a South  Korean travel company, from July 2020 to September 2021, and involved drivers of four regional buses that  travel more than 7,000kms per month.\n",
      "  The solution developed by Hankook is aimed at improving fuel efficiency and extending tire life.\n",
      " The  company collected and analyzed various data with a driving recorder, GPS and tire sensor attached to  vehicles.\n",
      " Hankook monitored data and carried out analysis of each bus driver’s driving habits, such as  speed, rapid acceleration and deceleration, braking and idling.\n",
      " Based on the result, the tire manufacturer  delivered an improvement guide to EHWA Air and Travel Agency for driver training, tire maintenance and  vehicle management.\n",
      "  The data collected by the tire maker revealed that there is more tire wear and fuel usage from increased  braking time and when the engine is left running idly.\n",
      " The biggest difference revealed in the test data was  up to a 20% drop in fuel usage when avoiding frequent braking and engine idling.\n",
      "  In addition, it was observed that tire pressure commonly decreased in the winter season.\n",
      " Due to low  temperatures, air pressure inside a tire which normally is around 120 psi dropped to as low as 96 psi.\n",
      "  Based on this finding, Hankook says it is evident that tire pressure inspection is critical in winter and  checking tire pressure every two months can reduce fuel consumption.\n",
      "  Hankook noted that its optimization solution is beneficial in economic and environmental aspects.\n",
      " Changing  driving habits such as sudden braking and idling can lower operating costs as well as the amount of carbon  dioxide generated, it said.\n",
